      What experience (if any) do you have with programming?
      (None is fine!)

      I took Max/MSP and did some VERY basic lua scripting with video game modding in my youth

<p>    <h1>Think Like a Programmer</h1>
    <div class="question">
      Pretend you are writing a plugin that automatically harmonizes with MIDI input.
      What instructions would you give a computer to do this programmatically?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">

      I would define 12 frequencies which would be the western chromatic scale,
      for a given input (1 of those 12) I would instruct the program to add an additional voice ex. input = 1 output = 1, and +3

    </div> <p>
  <p>  <div class="question">
        Pick an instrument and pretend you are writing an app that mimics that instrument.
      How would you model the istrument in a way the computer would understand?
      Think about what different objects (e.g. "string" for a guitar) it might
      need and what properties (e.g. "pitch"), events (e.g. "pluck"),
      and methods (e.g. "playPitch()") would be useful.

      Organ:
      As the organ gets its characteristic sound from mixing different timbres and harmonic overtones, this would be  the primary
      modeling trait.  As the instrument does not have different velocities we would not need to worry about this.

      (are we approaching this from a sampling perspective or synthesis?)
      If sampling, I would define the keyboard range as 61 pitches (the standard manual for an organ)
      Then I would make recordings of each pitch using the differnt stops (ex; flute, reed, foundation, and mixture)
      finally I would create a program to somehow compile all of these recordings together (i could do this in max, and will
      hopefully learn how to do it in text based enviroment) lastly I would have some sort of UI element such as a keyboard
      that could be clicked or touched in order to trigger the corresponding sample.
