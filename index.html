    <div class="question">
      What experience (if any) do you have with programming?
      (None is fine!)
    </div>
    <div class="answer">

      I took a basic HTML class in college about 10 years ago, did have a wordpress
      website for a while but switched to squarespace a few years ago becuase its much easier
      to maintain and easier to make look nice.

    <div class="question">
      What's something you'd like to be able to build/do with programming?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">

      Don't have strong intentions in terms of what I'd like to build or do with
      programming, but being able to make a more interesting website for myself
      or others would be useful. But at the moment I just want a greater understanding
      of how programming works since so much of the world is governed by it, and <link rel="import" href="">
      it has immense value in our society.

    <h1>Think Like a Programmer</h1>
    <div class="question">
      Pretend you are writing a plugin that automatically harmonizes with MIDI input.
      What instructions would you give a computer to do this programmatically?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">

      I would first define harmony as a property, then define the event as the act of
      harmonizing to the incoming midi input, then give the method of specific
      harmonization, such as "major3rd"

    </div>
    <div class="question">
      Pick an instrument and pretend you are writing an app that mimics that instrument.
      How would you model the istrument in a way the computer would understand?
      Think about what different objects (e.g. "string" for a guitar) it might
      need and what properties (e.g. "pitch"), events (e.g. "pluck"),
      and methods (e.g. "playPitch()") would be useful.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">

      I'll pick the saxophone since that is my primary instrument, though I may be shooting
      myself in the foot since there are many variables. The primary objects would
      be the different buttons to press down which result in different notes. I would
      call these "button" and label them based on their corresonding name or finger on the sax (eg. button_lp;left pointer finger, or button_rm; right middle finger )
      There are a few properties, most notably pitch, which would be determined by which objects (or buttons)
      are activated. Other properties include articulation, vibrato, and dynamics. An event would
be blowing, in which all or some properties are activated. And the method would be combine these previously listed factors
